# Path Planning

This project deals with path planning for a vehicle driving on a simulated highway. 
The vehicle should avoid collisions with other traffic participants, adapt its speed to preceding vehicles and change lanes if it's safe and reasonable.

## Path generation

To drive the vehicle along the road, the simulator takes in a list of x-y-coordinates and moves the vehicle from one point to the next in 20 ms increments. 
The spacing of the these points therefore affects the velocity, acceleration and jerk which the vehicle experiences. 
The vehilce's path must be planned in a "smooth" manner, as to avoid exceeding comfortable or even physical limits of acceleration.
